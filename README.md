# Kulaan

There is a 2015 study that found that the average net worth of a black family in Boston is $8 compared to $247,000 for the average white family in the city of Boston.

This reality led to the inspiration for Kulaan. A full stack application that allows users to log in and quickly find the nearest black business selling the goods or providing the services that the user is in need of. 

Kulaan is a Somali word meaning "to meet" or "to gather" and that is the core of the application is to gather around Black business and the Black community as a whole and help improve on our position as a community by investing in our businesses.
