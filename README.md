There is a 2015 study that found that the average net worth of a black family in Boston is $8 compared to $247,000 for the average white family in the city of Boston.
 
This reality led to the inspiration for Kulaan. A full stack application that allows users to update a publicly available database that houses relevant information regarding black business.
 
Kulaan is a Somali word meaning "to meet" or "to gather" and that is the core principle  of the application is to gather around Black business and the Black community as a whole and help improve on our position as a community by investing in our businesses.
